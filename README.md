# VvII-lab2
"Introduction to AI" laboratory work from the Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University "LETI". Continuation of the [first lab work](https://github.com/xalerthur/VvII-lab1). BFS and UCS changed to the Greedy search and the A* algorithms. Also added a Missed cells and a Manhattan dist heuristics.

**Note**: BestFS is actually a Greedy search!
